# EduSoC
Minimalistic SoC framework for the Digilent Arty S7 FPGA board, intended for educational development of a RISC-V core.

Developed for the Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering at the University of Stuttgart.

All SoC code is in the "soc" folder (aside from the IP configuration file in the "edusoc_system.srcs" folder).
Also provided are tools for programming the SoC over UART, test benches, and an example EduSoC project for Vivado 2022.2.
